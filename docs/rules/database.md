# Database Rules

Rules for all code that reads from or writes to the Drift database.

---

## One repo per table

All DB access goes through a repo class in `lib/core/db/repositories/`.
Never query Drift tables directly from a provider, service, or UI file.

```
UI → Provider → Service → Repo → Drift table
```

---

## No raw SQL outside repos

All queries use Drift's type-safe API. Raw SQL (`customSelect`, `customInsert`) is
allowed only inside the repo for the table it owns.

---

## Atomic read-mutate-write for chat sessions

`ChatRepo.put()` is a direct write. When you need to **read + modify + write** a session
(e.g. append a message, patch a field), you must do it atomically inside a Drift
`transaction()` to prevent concurrent writes from interleaving:

```dart
// NEVER:
final session = await chatRepo.getByCharacterId(charId);
session.messages.add(newMsg);
await chatRepo.put(session); // race: another write may have happened between read and write

// ALWAYS (inside a transaction or via a dedicated repo method):
await db.transaction(() async {
  final session = await chatRepo.getByCharacterId(charId);
  final updated = session.copyWith(messages: [...session.messages, newMsg]);
  await chatRepo.put(updated);
});
```

Prefer adding a dedicated repo method (e.g. `appendMessage`) that encapsulates
the transaction rather than doing it ad hoc in a service. Dedicated atomic
methods on `ChatRepo` include `appendSwipeToMessage`,
`appendAgentSwipe({kind: 'cleaned' | 'final'})` (nested blue sub-swipe +
`_syncAgentSwipesToMeta`), `updateAgentSwipeContent` / `removeAgentSwipe`
(in-place swipe editers used by the swipe-first cleaner flow — re-sync
`swipesMeta` the same way), and the chat/character variable-scope methods.

---

## Save before state cleanup

When finalizing a generation, persist data to DB **before** clearing reactive state.
If you clear `ChatState.isGenerating = false` first and the DB write fails, data is lost.

Order:
1. `chatRepo.put(finalSession)`
2. `state = state.copyWith(isGenerating: false, ...)`

---

## Schema migrations

All schema changes go in `AppDatabase.migration` in `app_db.dart`.
Bump the schema version and add a `from → to` migration step.
Never modify existing column types without a migration.

Current version: **71**

Migration history:
- v18: added `characters.picksHash`
- v19: added `characters.createdAt` + data migration (`SET created_at = updated_at WHERE created_at = 0`)
- v20: added `extension_presets` and `info_blocks` tables (extension system)
- v21: added `api_configs.cacheControlTtl` (Anthropic prompt cache control: 'off' | '5min' | '1h')
- v22: added `info_blocks.status` TEXT DEFAULT `'done'` + `info_blocks.order_` INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (block execution order + run status for ext blocks redesign)
- v23: added `api_configs.protocol` TEXT DEFAULT `'openai'` — wire protocol selector (openai / anthropic / gemini / openrouter). Drives `ChatTransport` factory routing
- v24: added `api_configs.topK` INTEGER DEFAULT 0, `api_configs.frequencyPenalty` REAL DEFAULT 0, `api_configs.presencePenalty` REAL DEFAULT 0
- v25: added `api_configs.cacheBreakpointMode` TEXT DEFAULT `'depth'` — Anthropic/OpenRouter prompt cache marker placement (`depth` / `stable_prefix`); `api_configs.sessionIdMode` TEXT DEFAULT `'openrouter'` — controls when `session_id` is sent for provider sticky routing
- v26: version bump only — no schema change (guards added to v20–v25 migration blocks)
- v27: added `info_blocks.swipe_id` INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (scopes ext blocks per message swipe); backfill `api_configs` columns missing from partial migrations (`top_k`, penalties, cache/session modes)
- v28: data migration — `UPDATE info_blocks SET swipe_id = 0 WHERE swipe_id IS NULL` (backfill for rows that survived v27 with NULL)
- v29: added `memory_catalog_rows` table for rebuildable per-session Memory Catalog state
- v30: added `chat_summaries.enabled` BOOL DEFAULT 1 (+ backfill NULL → 1)
- v31: added `character_folders` + `character_folder_members` tables (local character folders; composite PK `{folderId, charId}` enforces no-duplicate-within-folder)
- v32: added `characters.tokenCount` INTEGER DEFAULT 0 (cached estimated token count; computed on import/save, backfilled in background for existing rows)
- v33: added `characters.variantGroupId` TEXT + `characters.variantName` TEXT + `characters.variantOrder` INTEGER (character variations: rows sharing `variant_group_id` collapse to one list card; backfill sets each existing character's group to its own `char_id`)
- v34: added `characters.hidden` BOOL DEFAULT 0 (hideable characters: excludes a character/group from the My Characters list)
- v35: added Memory Graph tables (`memory_entity_rows`, `memory_salience_rows`, `memory_cadence_rows`, `memory_consolidation_rows`)
- v36: added `studio_config_rows`
- v37: added Studio `buildApiConfigId` / `runApiConfigId`
- v38: added Studio selected block ids fields
- v39: added Studio `finalPresetId`
- v40: added Studio request preset ids
- v41: added Studio preset overrides JSON
- v42: added Studio `profileId` / `profileName` for reusable session-bound profiles
- v43: added Studio `builderPromptTemplate` override for editable Studio rebuild prompts
- v44: added Studio `maxFinalHistoryMessages` INTEGER DEFAULT 15 (raised to 30 in v64) — caps trailing chat messages sent to the final Studio generator (0 = unlimited); a 60K token budget is also enforced (whichever limit is hit first); Studio trackers receive their own `StudioAgent.contextSize` (default 5, hard-cap 200) instead — see INV-ST1/INV-ST2 in `docs/INVARIANTS.md`
- v45: added `tracker_rows` table — lightweight key-value session state. Composite PK `{sessionId, name}`; indexed on `{sessionId, scope}`. Studio Ledger is the sole automatic model writer for canonical tracker state; manual canon overrides/locks use the same infrastructure. Rows are deleted in `chatRepo.deleteByCharacterId` and `characterRepo.delete` cascades and are shown in the Agentic Ops “Tracker values” tab.
- v46: added `studio_config_rows.routing_mode` TEXT DEFAULT `'verbatim'` — controls how preset blocks become agent instructions (`verbatim` = blocks concatenated дословно, no LLM call; `compiled` = legacy LLM digest). The decomposition service (`studio_decomposition_service.dart`) was restored after Phase 2: `decompose()` produces `StudioAgent`s (trackers + one final generator) that slot into `runTrackerCycle`; `routing_mode = 'compiled'` triggers the LLM builder, `'verbatim'` concatenates blocks directly.
- v50: added `tracker_snapshots` table — per-agent-swipe immutable snapshots of all trackers (mirrors Marinara-Engine's `game_state_snapshots`). Composite PK `{sessionId, messageId, swipeId, agentSwipeId}`; columns `trackersJson` (JSON array of `Tracker.toJson`), `committed` (0/1), `createdAt` (epoch seconds). Three indexes on `(sessionId, committed, createdAt)` support fast `getLatestCommitted` reads. `TrackerSnapshotRepo` owns all access; snapshots preserve Ledger state for deletion, regeneration, swipe, and branch rollback.
- v51: data migration — aggregates `tracker_rows` per session into a baseline snapshot at the sentinel anchor `(messageId='', committed=1)`. Legacy sessions that had `tracker_rows` but no snapshots get a one-time baseline so the snapshot-first read path (Phase 3) finds data immediately. The sentinel anchor is never dropped by `deleteForMessage` (only by `deleteBySessionId` / `deleteByCharacterId`).
- v52: dropped `pipeline_settings_rows` — pipeline settings moved to a singleton in SharedPreferences (key `pipelineSettings`), per-session overrides abandoned. SharedPreferences payload unaffected.
- v53: added `info_blocks.agentSwipeId` INTEGER DEFAULT -1 — binds ext blocks to the blue cleaned sub-swipe so blocks launched after the POST-cleaner target the cleaned text. -1 = "no agent swipe" (legacy blocks, match by `(messageId, swipeId)` only).
- v54: added `studio_preset_rows` table — Studio prompts (controller ontology, runtime envelope, final brief, cleaner and Ledger prompts, beauty shard, extractors, block router, brief parser, shard synthesizers) migrated to a DB table so the user can edit them without code changes. Seeded with the then-current hardcoded values via a single INSERT. See `docs/PLAN_STUDIO_PRESET_DB.md`.
- v55: Studio config overhaul — added `studio_preset_id`, `expensive_api_config_id`, `cheap_api_config_id`, `cleaner_api_config_id`; dropped `source_preset_id`, `source_preset_hash`, `routing_mode`, `agent_studio_preset_id`, `final_studio_preset_id`, `studio_preset_overrides_json`, `builder_prompt_template`, `selected_block_ids_json`, `selected_block_ids_initialized`, `build_api_config_id`, `build_model_override`. Unbinds Studio from user presets, switches to 3 API config slots + `studioPresetId`.
- v56: historical data migration — originally added `cleaner_beauty` and refreshed the then-active `writeloop_system` block. The generic write-loop is retired; current migration code adds current missing seed blocks but preserves existing user `writeloop` JSON as inert data.
- v57: data migration — moves `cleaner_beauty` to the end of the cleaner section (`order` 99) so the LLM sees styling instructions last among preset blocks (recency effect).
- v58: data migration — `<lumiaooc>` coloring moved out of the LLM cleaner prompt into deterministic code (`wrapLumiaOocColors` in `beauty_state_parser.dart`). Force-updates the `cleaner_beauty` and `final_lumia_ooc` blocks in the existing `default` preset from the updated seed so the old lumiaooc coloring rule and the `reserved.lumia_ooc` JSON-shape field are dropped. Existing user customizations to other blocks are preserved.
- v68: added `character_knowledge_fact_rows` and `character_session_baseline_rows` for provenance-backed character developments and card baselines.
- v71: removed the retired `durableFacts` contract from the default Ledger prompt.

## Atomic single-column updates

For status fields that change frequently (e.g. block run status during extension
post-generation), use a dedicated repo method that updates only the target column
rather than reading and re-writing the entire row:

```dart
// GOOD — atomic, minimal I/O
Future<void> updateStatus(String id, BlockRunStatus status) =>
    (db.update(db.infoBlocks)..where((t) => t.id.equals(id)))
        .write(InfoBlocksCompanion(status: Value(status.name)));

// BAD — full row read-mutate-write for a single column change
final block = await getById(id);
await put(block.copyWith(status: status));
```

Pattern: `InfoBlocksRepository.updateStatus()` is the canonical example.

---

## Atomic read-mutate-write for JS variable scopes

The JS bridge (`JsBridgeService._updateScope`) writes four variable
scopes. The `chat` and `character` scopes go through dedicated repo
methods that wrap the read-modify-write in a Drift transaction so two
concurrent bridge calls cannot interleave:

```dart
// ChatRepo.updateSessionVarsJson
await db.transaction(() async {
  final session = await repo.getById(sessionId);
  final next = mutator(_decodeChatVars(session.sessionVars));
  if (next.isEmpty) session.sessionVars.remove(_chatVarsKey);
  else session.sessionVars[_chatVarsKey] = jsonEncode(next);
  await repo.put(session);
});

// CharacterRepo.updateExtensionsJson — same shape, on the extensions map.
```

`global` variables go through `GlobalVariablesRepo` (SharedPreferences
JSON) with a serialized write lock (`_writeLock`) and a 64 KiB payload
cap. `message` variables are in-memory only (`MessageVariablesNotifier`).

**Never** do `getById → mutate → put` for any of these scopes —
always go through the dedicated repo method.

---

## Embedding storage

Table: `Embeddings`
Schema: `{ entryId, sourceType, sourceId, vectorsBlob (BLOB), textHash, retrievalHintsJson (JSON text), errorJson (JSON text), updatedAt }`

- Vectors stored as binary float32 BLOB via `vectorListToBytes()` free function in `vector_math.dart` (not a method on `EmbeddingRepo`).
- `textHash` used for dirty-check: if hash matches stored hash, skip re-embedding.
- `sourceType`: `'lorebook_entry'` | `'memory_entry'`
- `entryId` namespaced as `lorebookId_entryId` to prevent cross-lorebook collisions.
- `retrievalHintsJson` is JSON text (not BLOB).
- `errorJson` stores embedding error details (classification via `EmbeddingErrorLabel`).

---

## Deletion cascades

### `CharacterRepo.delete(charId)` (inside DB transaction, defensive)

1. Gets session IDs for the character
2. Deletes `MemoryBookRows` by session IDs
3. Deletes `TrackerRows` by session IDs (agentic memory trackers)
4. Deletes `TrackerSnapshots` by session IDs (Phase 1 tracker-snapshot rollback system — cascade alongside `TrackerRows` so legacy and snapshot stores are cleaned together)
5. Deletes `ChatSummaries` by session IDs
6. Deletes `ChatSessions` by character ID
7. Deletes `Characters` by charId

This path is used by direct repo callers (e.g. sync engine). It is idempotent.

**Does NOT delete:**
- `Embeddings` — done separately in `CharactersNotifier.remove()`
- `Lorebooks` — character-scoped lorebooks deleted separately in `CharactersNotifier.remove()`

### `chatRepo.deleteByCharacterId(characterId)` (preferred path for bulk character-scoped cleanup)

Deletes in order:
1. `MemoryBookRows` for all sessions of the character
2. `TrackerRows` for all sessions of the character (agentic memory trackers)
3. `TrackerSnapshots` for all sessions of the character (Phase 1 cascade — `trackerSnapshotRepoProvider.deleteBySessionId` per session)
4. `ChatSummaries` for all sessions of the character
5. `ChatSessions` for the character

Returns the list of deleted session IDs (for sync-deletion tracking).

### `CharactersNotifier.remove(id)` (provider-level, wraps repo + extra cleanup)

1. Deletes character-scoped lorebooks (`lorebookRepo.getByScopeAndTarget('character', id)`)
2. Deletes embeddings for those lorebooks (`embeddingRepo.deleteBySourceId(lorebookId)`)
3. Cleans stale IDs from `lorebookActivations` SharedPreferences map
4. Calls `chatRepo.deleteByCharacterId(id)` — fully cleans `MemoryBookRows`, `ChatSummaries`, and `ChatSessions` for the character (see above)
5. Calls `repo.delete(id)` — deletes the `Characters` row (its internal defensive cleanup of per-session rows is a no-op after step 4, since sessions are already gone)

This order guarantees no orphan `MemoryBookRows` or `ChatSummaries` rows after character deletion.

When adding a new table with per-character or per-session data, add its deletion to the appropriate cascade path (`deleteByCharacterId` for session-scoped data, or `CharactersNotifier.remove` for character-scoped auxiliary data).

---

## Reactive streams

`CharacterRepo.watchAll()` returns a `Stream<List<Character>>` (Drift reactive query).
`CharactersNotifier` subscribes to this stream — UI rebuilds automatically on any change.

For other tables that need reactive updates, add a `watch*` method to the repo.
Do not poll; use Drift streams.

---

## MemoryBook compatibility cleanup (v66)

`MemoryBookRows.entriesJson` and `pendingDraftsJson` are JSON TEXT blobs, so
adding model fields requires no Drift schema migration. Pre-v66 builds could
create `source: 'agentic'` entries through the generic tracker write-loop.
That writer is retired.

`AppDatabase.purgeRetiredAgenticMicroMemory()` is intentionally retained for
schema upgrades and backup/cloud restores. It removes only those historical
agentic entries/drafts and their derived embedding/catalog/entity/salience rows;
it preserves manual entries, scan drafts, range summaries, Studio Ledger facts,
and MemoryBook settings. Normal MemoryBook scan and approval flows remain
user-directed and go through `MemoryBookRepo`.

Deleting an assistant message still calls
`MemoryBookRepo.deleteForMessage(sessionId, messageId)` to retract any normal
MemoryBook items sourced from that message.

---

## Tracker snapshot rollback system

`tracker_snapshots` is an immutable per-agent-swipe snapshot of canonical
tracker state, written after Studio Ledger applies an accepted update. Rollback
is **emergent**: deleting rows makes the preceding committed snapshot the
latest, then `tracker_rows` is restored from it.

### Granularity

Each snapshot is anchored at `(sessionId, messageId, swipeId, agentSwipeId)`:
- `messageId` — the assistant message whose accepted state Ledger recorded.
- `swipeId` — which swipe of that message (regen creates new swipes).
- `agentSwipeId` — which agent sub-swipe (e.g. `'final'` vs `'cleaned'`).

This per-agent-swipe granularity (chosen explicitly over per-message or
per-session) lets the rollback system restore state at the exact level the
user navigates: swiping back through agent sub-swipes restores the matching
tracker state.

### Sentinel anchor for legacy data

Migrated `tracker_rows` (Phase 7 migration v51) become a baseline snapshot
at the sentinel anchor `(messageId='', committed=1)`. This anchor is
**never** dropped by `deleteForMessage` (only by `deleteBySessionId` /
`deleteByCharacterId`), so legacy sessions always have a baseline until the
session itself is deleted.

### Write path

Studio Ledger applies typed tracker operations, re-reads the resulting state,
and upserts an immutable snapshot at that anchor via
`TrackerSnapshotRepo.upsertTrackers`. The snapshot is initially `committed=0`.

`commitLatest` is called by `ChatNotifier.sendMessage` just before the next
generation starts. Committed snapshots are surfaced by the read path;
uncommitted snapshots are tentative state from the most recent Ledger pass.

`post_cleaner_service.applyCleanedText` (Phase 2) clones the parent
message's snapshot into the new `'cleaned'` agent-swipe anchor so the
cleaned sub-swipe inherits the parent's tracker state.

### Read path (snapshot-first)

The Ledger and tracker-values UI call `getLatestCommitted` / `getLatest` and
fall back to `trackerRepoProvider.getBySessionId` when no snapshot exists
(legacy sessions that have not yet produced a snapshot).

### Rollback paths

| User action | Repo method | Effect |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Delete a message | `ChatRepo.deleteMessage` → `trackerSnapshotRepo.deleteForMessage` + `trackerRepo.replaceForSession` + `memoryBookRepo.deleteForMessage` | All snapshots at that `messageId` are dropped; the preceding committed snapshot becomes the latest. The live `tracker_rows` store is restored from it, so Tracker values and Studio state reflect the prior accepted message. MemoryBook items whose `messageIds` contains the deleted `messageId` are also dropped. |
| Delete a session | `chat_history_provider.deleteSession` → `deleteBySessionId` + `SyncDeletionTracker.record('tracker_snapshot', sessionId)` | All snapshots for the session are dropped; cloud sync deletion is tracked. |
| Clear chat | `chat_session_service.clearChat` → `deleteBySessionId` (both paths) | Same as delete-session. |
| Delete by character | `chatRepo.deleteByCharacterId` → cascade `deleteBySessionId` per session | All snapshots for all of the character's sessions are dropped. |
| Swipe removal | `trackerSnapshotRepo.shiftSwipeIdsAfterRemoval` | Re-keys snapshots whose `swipeId` > removed id, preserving continuity. |
| Branch session | `chat_session_service.branchSession` → `copyForSessionBranch` | Copies snapshots for sliced message IDs to the new session ID. |

### Cloud sync coverage (Phase 9)

`tracker_snapshots` is in the backup whitelist (`backup_exporter.dart`,
backup `_schemaVersion` 5) and has full cloud sync coverage via
`SyncTrackerSnapshotStore` + `TrackerSnapshotSyncStore` adapter. Sync
follows the InfoBlock per-session collection pattern: one entry per
session, payload `{__trackerSnapshots:true, items:[...]}`. Deletes are
tracked via `SyncDeletionTracker.record('tracker_snapshot', sessionId)`.

### Never

- **Never** read-modify-write a `ChatSession` / `Character` from outside
  the dedicated atomic repo methods (this applies to the chat/character
  variable scopes — see "Atomic read-mutate-write for JS variable scopes"
  above). Tracker snapshots follow the same rule: use
  `TrackerSnapshotRepo.upsertTrackers` / `deleteForMessage` /
  `deleteBySessionId` etc. — never `getById → mutate → put`.
- **Never** mutate an existing snapshot row. Snapshots are write-once; the
  only allowed writes are `upsertTrackers` (insert-or-replace by PK),
  `commit` / `commitLatest` (flip `committed` 0→1), and delete methods.
- **Never** drop the sentinel anchor `(messageId='')` via
  `deleteForMessage`. Only `deleteBySessionId` / `deleteByCharacterId`
  may drop it.
